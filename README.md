Conversion spreadsheet of gene homologs between *Aspergillus fumigatus* strains A1163 and AF293.

## Generation

The spreadsheet was generated by creating an online Biomart query ([https://www.ensembl.org/biomart/](https://www.ensembl.org/biomart/martview/ed77c8d2c6fe39cd00a2a6a7d8db261f)) using the Ensembl Fungi database. 

## Disclaimers

The spreadsheet was generated sometime prior to 2019, details of the initial query and database used are missing. Homology was purely assessed based on the pre-existing ortholog data at the time, so accuracy may vary.
